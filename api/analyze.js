 * SECURITY-FIRST COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS API
 * 
 * ENTERPRISE-GRADE DATA PROTECTION:
 * ✅ NO document content is stored, logged, or cached anywhere
 * ✅ NO document content is included in cache keys or logs
 * ✅ All analysis is performed in-memory and discarded immediately
 * ✅ Minimal document hash generation (first 100 chars only) for logging
 * ✅ No persistent storage of uploaded files or analysis results
 * ✅ Secure for enterprise use with sensitive internal standards documents
 * 
 * COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORKS SUPPORTED:
 * - NIST CSF v2.0 (82+ controls)
 * - NIST SP 800-53 (AU, IA, IR, SC categories)
 * - PCI DSS
 * - ISO 27001
 * - SOC 2
 * 
 * STRICTNESS LEVELS:
 * - Strict: 10-30% typical coverage, requires explicit evidence
 * - Balanced: 30-60% typical coverage, reasonable interpretation
 * - Lenient: 50-80% typical coverage, broad interpretation

CRITICAL STRICTNESS DIFFERENTIATION - You MUST produce DIFFERENT results for each strictness level:

${strictness === 'strict' ? `
STRICT MODE - BE EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE:
- Only mark as "covered" if you find EXPLICIT, CLEAR evidence like:
  * "we implement [specific control]"
  * "established procedures for [control]"
  * "documented process for [control]"
  * "our policy states [control requirement]"
  * "we have [specific tool/technology] for [control]"
- If evidence is vague, implied, or general, mark as "gap"
- When in doubt, mark as "gap"
- Be very strict - expect 10-30% coverage maximum
- Look for SPECIFIC implementation details, not general statements
- Require concrete examples and specific procedures
- Downgrade "partial" controls to "gap" if evidence is not explicit enough
- Be extremely critical of any evidence that could be interpreted as insufficient` : strictness === 'balanced' ? `
BALANCED MODE - MODERATE INTERPRETATION:
- Mark as "covered" with reasonable evidence like:
  * Policies mentioned that relate to the control
  * Procedures described that address the control
  * Can infer from related controls or general practices
  * Industry standard practices mentioned
  * Good security practices that clearly address the control
- Be reasonable but not overly generous
- Expect 30-60% coverage
- Look for GOOD evidence but don't require perfect specificity
- Accept reasonable inferences from described practices
- Maintain moderate standards - not too strict, not too lenient` : `
LENIENT MODE - BE GENEROUS:
- Mark as "covered" with ANY reasonable indication:
  * Basic policies mentioned
  * Common industry practices
  * General security measures
  * Can infer from organizational context
  * Any security-related activities that could address the control
  * General security awareness or practices mentioned
- Be generous in interpretation
- Expect 50-80% coverage
- Look for ANY evidence that suggests the control is addressed, even indirectly
- Accept broad interpretations and organizational context clues
- Be willing to infer coverage from general security practices mentioned
- Upgrade "partial" controls to "covered" if there's any reasonable basis
- Look for positive interpretations of any security-related content`}

MANDATORY: Your analysis MUST reflect the strictness level. A document analyzed as "strict" should have LOWER coverage than "balanced", and "balanced" should have LOWER coverage than "lenient" for the same content.

CONTROL STRUCTURE TO USE:
${JSON.stringify(filteredFrameworkData.categories, null, 2)}

For each control, analyze the document content and mark as:
- "covered": Control is fully addressed with clear evidence
- "partial": Control is partially addressed  
- "gap": Control is not addressed

Look for evidence like: policies, procedures, "we implement", "access controls", "security policies", "monitoring", "audit".

IMPORTANT: Do NOT return generic error messages. If you cannot analyze a specific control, mark it as "gap" with a brief explanation of what evidence you looked for.

Return valid JSON using the exact control structure above.`;
