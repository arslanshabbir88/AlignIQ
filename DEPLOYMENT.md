# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. White Background Issue ✅
- **Problem**: App wasn't filling the full page, leaving white margins
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed max-width constraints from `#root` CSS
  - Added full viewport coverage CSS
  - Set body background to dark color
  - Added proper overflow handling

### 2. Function Timeout Error ✅
- **Problem**: `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT` error during analysis
- **Solution**:
  - Increased function timeout from 15s to 30s in `vercel.json`
  - Added request timeout handling (12s) for AI API calls
  - Implemented fallback analysis when AI API fails
  - Added better error handling and logging

## How to Redeploy

1. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix white background and timeout issues"
   git push
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically redeploy** if you have auto-deployment enabled

3. **Or manually redeploy** from Vercel dashboard

## What the Fixes Do

### CSS Fixes
- `src/App.css`: Removed max-width and padding constraints
- `src/index.css`: Added full viewport coverage
- `index.html`: Added dark body background and viewport meta

### API Fixes
- `api/analyze.js`: Added timeout handling and fallback logic
- `vercel.json`: Increased function timeout and added CORS headers

### Fallback System
- If AI API is slow (>12s), falls back to intelligent mock analysis
- If no API key configured, uses mock analysis
- Ensures users always get results, even if AI is unavailable

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Check background**: Should be dark with no white margins
2. **Test file upload**: Upload `test-document.txt`
3. **Test analysis**: Should work without timeout errors
4. **Check responsiveness**: Should work on all screen sizes

## Environment Variables

Make sure you have these set in Vercel:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key (optional - will use fallback if not set)

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:
1. Check Vercel function logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check browser console for CSS/JS errors
4. Ensure all files were committed and pushed
